# Python Workshop Series Setup

For the JHU Python workshop series we recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), an all-in-one installer for Python. Anaconda Python includes a user interface to make it easy to launch Python applications and manage packages and environments without using command-line commands.

We will be using Python 3 for the JHU Python workshop series, so if you choose not to install Python using Anaconda (although we recommend it) please ensure you install Python version 3.x (e.g., 3.8 is fine).

We will teach Python using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), a programming environment that runs in a web browser (Jupyter Notebook will be installed by Anaconda). For this to work you will need a reasonably up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers are all supported (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not).

7. At the Advanced Installation Options window, ensure that "Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable" is not selected, and "Register Anaconda3 as my default Python 3.8" is selected. Then select "Install". If you have an existing Python installation that you are currently using, then do not select "Register Anaconda3 as my default Python 3.8", as this will replace your current Python version as the default.
